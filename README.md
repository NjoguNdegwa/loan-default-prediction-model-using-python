loan-default-prediction-model-using-python
This project builds a loan default prediction model using synthetic data inspired by SBI’s FY2025 Annual Report.

Data Source

SBI Annual Report FY2025
Key Credit Risk Metrics:
Gross NPA Ratio: 1.82%
Net NPA Ratio: 0.47%
Sector-wise Advances & NPAs (Agriculture, Industry, Services, Personal Loans)
Methodology

Generated synthetic loan-level dataset using SBI’s sector-wise NPA ratios.
Simulated borrower attributes (income, credit score, loan amount, tenure).
Built a Logistic Regression model to classify defaults.
Evaluated using ROC-AUC and classification metrics.
Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook (EDA + Modelling)
Future Enhancements

Try advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
Link model outputs to Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Basel capital requirements.
Extend with open banking datasets.
